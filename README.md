## Versioning Strategy / Commit format
The project follows Semantic Versioning where version numbers are assigned in the format of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
Commit messages are formatted as follows:
- `Feature: <description>` for new features.

- `Docs: <description>` for documentation updates.
- `Style: <description>` for formatting and style changes.

Commit message body is a list of bullet points describing the changes made.

## Branching Strategy
- `master/main`: Stable, deployable code.
- `develop`: Ongoing development.
- Feature branches for new features and fixes.

## Trello Board Management
- Version-based lists for tracking progress.
- Backlog for future features.
- Regular review to update and refine tasks.
